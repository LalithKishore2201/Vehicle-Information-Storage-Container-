# Vehicle-Information-Storage-Container-With-Video-Recovering
Developing a model that can record major road accident information using sensors and share the information with the rescue personnels. 

# SYSTEM
In this system, there is an implementation of the black box concept on street vehicles. The architecture consists of a power supply, Arduino UNO, Crash Sensor(SW 18010-P), Temperature Sensor (LM35), Gas Sensor (MQ-2), GPS Module, GSM Module, I2C Liquid Crystal Display, SD Card Module, an ESP32 Camera.

# FUNCTION
The main objective is to develop a system that can store the data collected by the sensors and the camera and retrieve road accident information and transmit image data and accident data with the help of cloud technology. It stores and logs data continuously when a person is driving, this model helps in real-time monitoring of the vehicles and provides us with effective solutions when an investigation occurs.
